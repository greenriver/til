# Today I Learned (at Green River)

We are constantly learning new things.  This is a repo to share our learnings. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining a new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that we've learned.

Thanks to [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) for originating the idea and the above description.
